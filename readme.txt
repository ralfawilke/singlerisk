Lo, S.M.S. and Wilke, R.A. (2022): A single risk approach to the semiparametric copula competing risks model, Working Paper.

The paper considers parametric models and a semiparametric model. The following sample code is made available:

- "sample_code_AFT.zip" contains sample R-code for the estimation of the parametric AFT model and the estimation sample used in the application of the parametric approach. 

 "semiparametric_sample_code.R" contains sample R-code in relation to the semiparametric model, in particular for the simulation of data and for the estimation and specification testing.
